# Physical iPhone acceptance log

Status: **not run**. Record device, iOS, signed version/build, tester, timestamp, selected test app and observed result for each row. Save a screen recording plus Device Activity diagnostics for scheduled shield/clear cases. Simulator tests do not fill this log.

Apple's Device Activity callbacks follow device activity and are not a precise wall-clock alarm. Verify observed behavior before making timing claims. Schedule registration failures must leave app-owned restrictions cleared.

Qualified schedule review is also pending: compare supported methods, Hanafi/standard Asr, high-latitude rules, Dubai summer/winter, London summer and DST dates, and local Umm al-Qura Ramadan adjustments with matching trusted timetables.
